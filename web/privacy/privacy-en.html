        <h3 id="m13">Relevant legal bases</h3>
        <p>Below you will find an overview of the legal basis of the GDPR, on the basis of which we
            process personal data. Please note that, in addition to the provisions of the GDPR,
            national
            data protection regulations in your or our country of residence or domicile may apply.
            If,
            in addition, more specific legal bases apply in individual cases, we will inform you of
            these in the data protection declaration.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Legitimate interests (Art. 6 Abs. 1 S. 1 lit. f. GDPR)</strong> - The
                processing
                is necessary for the purposes of protecting the legitimate interests of the
                controller
                or a third party, unless the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the
                data
                subject which data subject, which require the protection of personal data, override
                these interests.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>In addition to the data protection regulations of the General Data Protection Regulation,
            national regulations on data protection in Germany are applicable. These include, in
            particular, the Act on Protection against Misuse of Personal Data in Data Processing
            (Federal Data Protection Act - FDPA). In particular, the FDPA contains special
            regulations
            on the right to information, the right to deletion, the right to object, the processing
            of
            special categories of personal data, the processing for other purposes and for
            transmission
            and automated decision-making in individual cases, including profiling. Furthermore, it
            regulates data processing for the purposes of employment relationship (Section 26 FDPA),
            in
            particular with regard to the establishment, implementation or termination of employment
            relationships as well as the consent of employees. Furthermore, the data protection laws
            of
            the individual federal states may apply.</p>
        <h2 id="m27">Security measures</h2>
        <p>We make decisions in accordance with the legal requirements, taking consideration of the
            state of the art, the implementation costs and the type, scope, circumstances and
            purposes
            of the processing, as well as the different probabilities of occurrence and the extent
            of
            the threat to the rights and freedoms of individuals. The data controller shall
            implement
            appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of appropriate
            protection.</p>
        <p>The measures include, in particular, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity and
            availability
            of data by controlling physical and electronic access to the data, as well as the
            electronic
            access to the data, access to the data, input of the data, transfer of the data,
            securing of
            the availability, and their separation. We have also set up procedures to ensure that
            data
            subjects' rights, the deletion of data, and responses to data compromise. Furthermore,
            we
            already take the protection of personal data into account when selecting of hardware,
            software, and processes in accordance with the principle of data protection, through
            technology design and through data protection-friendly default settings.</p>
        <p>SSL encryption (https): To protect your data transmitted via our online offer, we use SSL
            encryption. You can recognize such encrypted connections by the prefix https:// in the
            address bar of your browser.</p>
        <h2 id="m12">Data deletion</h2>
        <p>The data processed by us will be deleted in accordance with the legal requirements, as
            soon
            as their consents permitted for processing are revoked or other permissions cease to
            apply
            (e.g. if the purpose for processing of this data has ceased to apply or it is not
            required
            for the purpose).</p>
        <p>If the data is not deleted because it is required for other and legally permissible
            purposes,
            their processing will be limited to these purposes. I.e., the data is blocked and not
            processed for other purposes. This applies, for example, to data that must be retained
            for
            commercial or tax law or whose storage is required for the assertion, exercise or
            defense of
            legal claims, or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person is
            required.</p>
        <p>Our data protection notices may also contain further information on the retention and
            deletion of data that have priority for the respective processing operations.</p>
        <h2 id="m134">Cookies use</h2>
        <p>Cookies are small text files or other memory that store information on end devices and
            read
            information from the end devices. E.g. to record the login status in a user account, a
            shopping cart content in an an e-shop, the content accessed or the functions used in an
            online offer. Cookies can also be used for various purposes, e.g. for the purposes of
            the
            functionality, security and comfort of online offers as well as the creation of analyses
            of
            visitor flows. </p>
        <p><strong>Consent Notes: </strong>We use cookies in accordance with the legal regulations.
            Therefore, we obtain prior consent from users, except when this is not required by law.
            In
            particular, consent is not required if the storage and reading of the information,
            including
            cookies, are absolutely necessary to provide the user with a telemedia service expressly
            requested by the user (i.e. our online service). (i.e. our online offer). The revocable
            consent is clearly communicated to the users and contains the information on the
            respective
            cookie use.</p>
        <p><strong>Notes on the legal basis for data protection: </strong>On which legal basis under
            data protection law we process the personal data of users with the help of Cookies
            depends
            on whether we ask users for consent. If the users consent, the legal basis for
            processing
            their data is their declared consent. Otherwise, the data processed with the help of
            cookies
            is processed on the basis of our legitimate interests (e.g., in the business operation
            of
            our online offering and improvement of its usability) or, if this is done in the context
            of
            the fulfillment of our contractual obligations, if the use of cookies is necessary in
            order
            to fulfill our contractual obligations. For which purposes the cookies are processed by
            us,
            we clarify this in the course of this privacy policy or as part of our consent and
            processing procedures.</p>
        <p><strong>Storage period:&nbsp;</strong>With regard to the storage period, the following
            types
            are distinguished:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Temporary cookies (also: session cookies):</strong>&nbsp;Temporary Cookies
                are
                deleted at the latest after a user has left an online offering and closed his or her
                end
                device (e.g. browser or mobile application).
            </li>
            <li><strong>Permanent cookies:</strong> Permanent cookies remain stored even after the
                terminal device is closed. For example, the login status can be saved or preferred
                content can be displayed directly when the user visits a website again. Likewise,
                the
                user data collected with the help of cookies can be used for reach measurement. If
                we do
                not provide users with explicit information about the type and duration of cookies
                (e.g.
                when obtaining consent), users should assume that cookies are permanent and that the
                assume that cookies are permanent and can be stored for up to two years.

        <p><strong>Further guidance on processing operations, procedures and services:</strong></p>
        <ul class="m-elements">
            <li><strong>Processing of cookie data on the basis of consent: </strong>We use a cookie
                consent management procedure, in the context of which the consents of the users to
                the
                use of cookies, or to the processing and providers named in the cookie consent
                management procedure can be obtained, managed and revoked by the users. Here the
                declaration of consent is stored so that it does not have to be repeated and the
                consent
                is to be able to prove the consent in accordance with the legal obligation. This can
                be
                stored on the server side and/or in a cookie (so-called opt-in cookie, or with the
                help
                of comparable technologies), in order to be able to allocate the consent to a user
                or
                his device. Subject to individual information on the providers of cookie management
                services, the following information applies: The duration of the storage of the
                consent
                can be up to two years. In this case, a pseudonymous identifier is created and
                linked to
                the time of consent, information on the scope of the consent (e.g. of consent (e.g.,
                which categories of cookies and/or service providers) and the browser, system and
                end
                device used.

        </ul>
        <h2 id="m328">Plugins and embedded functions and content</h2>
        <p>We integrate into our online offer functional and content elements that are obtained from
            the
            servers of their respective providers (hereinafter referred to as "third-party
            providers").
            These may be, for example graphics, videos or city maps (hereinafter uniformly referred
            to
            as "content").</p>
        <p>The integration always requires that the third party providers of this content process
            the IP
            address of the user, since without the IP address they could not send the content to
            their
            browser. The IP address is therefore required for the presentation of these contents or
            functions. We endeavor to use only such content whose respective providers use the IP
            address only for the delivery of the content. Third-party providers may also use
            so-called
            pixel tags (invisible graphics, also known as "web beacons") for statistical or
            marketing
            purposes. The "pixel tags" can be used to collect information such as the visitor
            traffic on
            the pages of this website, which then can be evaluated. The pseudonymous information may
            also be stored in cookies on the user's device and may contain, among other things,
            technical information about the browser and the operating system, about referring
            websites
            time of visit as well as further information on the use of our online offer as well as
            be
            linked with such information from other sources.</p>
        <p><strong>Notes on legal bases:</strong> Insofar as we ask the users for their consent to
            the
            use of the third-party providers, the legal basis for the processing of data is their
            consent. Otherwise, the users' data is processed on the basis of our legitimate
            interests (i.e. interest in efficient, economical and recipient-friendly
            services) are processed. In this context, we would also like to refer you to the
